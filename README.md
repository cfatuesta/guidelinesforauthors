      <br>
      The cover letter should include the following:

- Manuscript title
- Manuscript classification (e.g., Article, Clinical / Scientific Note)
- Notification of any redundant or duplicate publication
- Notification of pre-publication on a preprint server (e.g., bioRxiv) and doi number, if applicable.  
- A statement that one author (the principal author or guarantor) takes full responsibility for the data, the analyses and interpretation, and the conduct of the research; that the author has full access to all of the data; and that the author has the right to publish any and all data separate and apart from any sponsor.
Author's statement of responsibility for clinical trial data and statement of the data results are required to be deposited in a clinical trials database (if applicable). It is the authors’ responsibility to deposit the results into the clinical trials database. See https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/fdaaa for more information.

      <br>
  
  - The title should be no more than 96 characters in length, including spaces, punctuation, and subtitle. Titles should be clinically interesting and informative. They may include widely accepted abbreviations.
 
  - The title page should include the names of the authors followed by their highest academic degrees (MD, PhD) and their institutional affiliations. Include full contact information (name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address) for the corresponding author.
  - To note common first authors, mark an asterisk following each of the common authors' highest academic degrees in the author byline. Identify the asterisk at the end of the same page and state, "These authors contributed equally to the manuscript." Note that when working through the online submission process, however, only one author can be designated as the corresponding author.
  - The corresponding author must specify who conducted the statistical analysis with their professional affiliation (academic, governmental, or commercial) listed.
  - If applicable, the title page should indicate "Supplemental Data" below the authors' affiliations. All Supplemental Data and electronic file names should also be listed on the title page. Please note that Neurology no longer allows supplemental data except Teaching Slides, Videos, and manuscripts with tracked changes (revisions only).
  - If the article was previously posted on a preprint server, include a section on the title page labeled: “Publication history”. Please use the following as an example: “Publication history: This manuscript was previously published in bioRxiv: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/307798125”.
  -Provide a word count for the paper and abstract and a character count for the title (including spaces and punctuation).
  - Include number of references, tables, and figures. The Author and Co-investigator (if applicable) Appendices are excluded from word count.
  - If applicable, authors should indicate study sponsorship or funding by listing it on the title page: Study funding: Supported by NIH (OR 76675882).
  - Authors should choose a maximum of 5 search terms that cover the aspects of the submitted article. Please designate the term and include the number to which it corresponds.
  - The second page must mention study sponsorship or funding (industry, government, or institutional) and then disclosures of all authors' financial relationships deemed relevant to the manuscript. Authors will be notified at the appropriate time to complete an online disclosure with all financial relationships (and those of their immediate family members) from the past two years regardless of whether these relationships are related to the study described in the submitted manuscript. If the study period of the submitted manuscript exceeded two years, financial relationships relevant to the topic must also be disclosed. Seesample disclosure statement. Note that the disclosure must mention any corporate sponsorship of the study first and government or institutional funding second. No dollar amounts need to be included. Disclosures should appear in the same order as in the manuscript byline. Structure of sentences should be as similar as possible to the example. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that relevant disclosures appear on the submitted, revised, and final accepted manuscripts and that the page proofs reflect the author disclosures listed. Every author should be included in the Disclosure Statement. If an author has no relevant disclosures, please use "Dr. AUTHOR reports no disclosures." (Please note that COMPLETE disclosures must be included on the online disclosure form and will appear online exactly as entered.) Authors should review their disclosures for accuracy on a regular basis and update the disclosures form in their personal record as necessary.
  - Also see Appendix section below for author and/or coinvestigator listings in appendices (name, affiliation, role, contribution). These appendices are now required.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <br>
  
Articles require structured abstracts that should not exceed 250 words (one double-spaced typed manuscript page). Abstracts should be lucid and readable; minimum statistics are sufficient. A structured abstract should be organized as follows:

1. Objective: In one sentence, state the hypothesis (‘e.g., to determine whether’) followed by the means by which it was tested.  Example: "Objective: To test the hypothesis that all frogs are made from cells, we dissected 42,000 frogs and performed histology on 5 organs, assuming this is as an adequate sample for generalizability."  If your study is exploratory, or hypothesis-generating, a statement to that effect should appear in the Objective section. 
2. Methods
3. Results
4. Conclusions
5. Classification of Evidence(required for studies of therapeutic interventions and diagnostic accuracy):
- Papers evaluated for classification of evidence must contain the section titled "Classification of Evidence" after the Conclusions section. In this section, please include the following in 25 words or less: "Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class [I, II, III, or IV] evidence that [Treatment] [reduces/increases/decreases/is well tolerated] results."
For example: “Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that certain dosages of mexiletine are well tolerated and effective in reducing handgrip relaxation.”
- This statement should be expanded to include other details in the Methods section.
- For Views/Reviews articles, provide a 150- to 250-word abstract, structured if possible. NeuroImages and Clinical/Scientific Notes do not require an abstract.

      <summary>Introduction</summary>
      <br>
  The introduction should not be more than 250 words. Be specific and concise in stating information related to the study. Refrain from reiterating known information.
  
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Methods</summary>
      <br>
  The Methods section must provide sufficient detail to allow replication of the study. As examples, the Methods should indicate nucleotide sequences used for RNA or DNA probes, what an antibody was made against and sources of antibodies, constructs for transgenic animals, and reagents and instruments used with the manufacturer's names and locations.

If the study reports a therapeutic intervention (clinical trial or use of medication, procedure, maneuver, or change in patient environment intended to benefit the patient) or diagnostic accuracy, the Methods must be sufficiently detailed to allow Classification of Evidence.

Papers evaluated for classification of evidence must contain a paragraph titled Classification of Evidence. In this paragraph, please state (a) the question(s) the investigation was designed to answer, specifically identifying the patient population, intervention of interest, and relevant outcomes; (b) the class of evidence (I, II, III, or IV) assigned to each question as determined by AAN criteria; and (c) a brief statement of the results of the study for each question. Detail dosages, percentages, years, and significance.

Examples:

Classification of evidence: This interventional study provides Class I evidence that warfarin (target INR 1.7 to 2.5) is equivalent to aspirin 81 mg daily in preventing recurrent strokes during an average of 3 years of follow-up in participants aged 20 to 70 with a history of stroke (relative risk of stroke warfarin vs aspirin 0.98, 95% CIs 0.81 to 1.10).

Methods/Primary research question: Has the introduction of adjunctive dexamethasone in the Netherlands improved outcome in pneumococcal meningitis? This study provides Class III evidence that dexamethasone reduced the proportion of participants with unfavorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of one to four) in the 2006-2009 cohort, as compared to the 1998-2002 cohort (39 vs. 50%; odds ratio, 0.63%; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.86; p=0.002). Mortality rates (20 vs. 30%; absolute risk difference, 10%; 95% confidence interval 4 to 17%; p=0.001) was also significantly lower in 2006-2009.

In a subsection on Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents, include the following:

A statement of approval by an ethical standards committee on human experimentation (institutional or regional) for any experiments using human participants.
A statement identifying the institutional or licensing committee approving experiments performed on live vertebrates and/or higher invertebrates.
A statement that written informed consent was obtained from all participants (or guardians of participants) in the study (consent for research). For a retrospective analysis that is IRB-approved, state that approval from an ethical standards committee to conduct this study was received.
A statement that authorization has been obtained for disclosure (consent-to-disclose) of any recognizable persons in photographs, videos, or other information that may be published in the Journal, in derivative works by the AAN, or on the Journal's Web site (when applicable).
A statement, if the study reports on a clinical trial, providing the identity of the public trials registry and the clinical trial identifier number.
Data Availability Policy

Neurology now requires a Data Availability statement to promote data transparency.  The statement must be included at the end of the Methods section of the article, under a separate subheading entitled “Data Availability Statement” or similar (see Author Center Policy area for details/further information).

To report previously published methods: In detail, summarize the previously published methods and insert citation. If you prefer to insert the previously published methods verbatim, please state: "We used the same methodology as the one employed in a previous study [citation]." Insert the published method verbatim immediately after the statement, citing it appropriately. If the verbatim wording is more than 200 words, supply permission to republish the content from the publisher of the original article.

      <summary>Figures</summary>
      <br>
    
   Authors should examine a recent issue of Neurology to plan the appropriate layout and size when preparing their figures.

Neurology is interested in 3-D or interactive figures. If you have figures that would be enhanced by this approach, please let the editors know and include these as part of your submission.
Proof of permission to reprint a figure from any source is required (as is permission to modify a figure, if applicable); figures previously published anywhere will not be published in Neurology without documented permission from the copyright holder.(Permissions should be uploaded as 'Additional Files' files at submission).
Color figures are published at no charge to authors.
Use Arial type within figures, capitalizing the first letters of first words of labels only. Ensure that the spacing between letters (kerning) is even (no letters closer together than the others) and that the lettering is crisp.
Per Journal style, each figure has a short title above it (the detailed legend is placed under the figure). Provide a short title (15 words or less) for each figure at the beginning of the Figure Legend in the manuscript file.
Title and Figure legends should be double-spaced and appear on a separate page at the end of the manuscript document file.
Footnotes should be noted as superscript a, b, c, etc.
Multipart figures should be labeled with capital letters A, B, C, (using Arial font) etc. in the upper left-hand corner of each panel. Please submit multipart figures as composite files. Panels should read from left to right, then down.
In graphs, standard symbols should be used for data points in the following order: closed circle, closed square, closed triangle, closed diamond, open circle, open square, open triangle, open diamond. To prevent wasted space, axes should end no more than one increment beyond the final data points. Explanatory lettering should not extend beyond the ends of the axes.
Remove extraneous lines from graphs.
Line graphs should be solid colored lines rather than dots and dashes.
Bar fill in bar graphs should be solid color rather than patterns.
Figures should not include titles or patient initials. Titles should be placed in the figure legend, not on the figure itself. Abbreviation keys should be placed in the figure legend unless they fit into the confines of the figure.
Internal scale markers must appear on microscopic photographs.
Remove white type from MRIs, CTs, etc.
To avoid perspective confusion, right and left sides of axial and coronal images must be marked appropriately with and R for right and/or L for left.
Number figures in the order of their mention in the text.
For supported electronic file requirements, see the section on Electronic Figure and Video Submission.

      <summary>Tables</summary>
      <br>
  Tables should be created using the table function in Word and included as part of the manuscript document file. Do not embed image files of tables and do not use tabs in creating tables. Authors should consult a recent issue of Neurology before designing tables.

Tables should be brief and easily understood without referring to the text.
Do not use color or shading within tables.
Do not include patient names or initials in the tables.
Place each table, including a title and legend (if applicable), on a separate page at the end of the manuscript file.
All tables must be double-spaced.
Number tables in the order of their mention in the text.
References cited within a table should use numbers rather than author names.
Tables should be no longer than two double-spaced manuscript pages.
