      <br>
  
  - The title should be no more than 96 characters in length, including spaces, punctuation, and subtitle. Titles should be clinically interesting and informative. They may include widely accepted abbreviations.
 
  - The title page should include the names of the authors followed by their highest academic degrees (MD, PhD) and their institutional affiliations. Include full contact information (name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address) for the corresponding author.
  - To note common first authors, mark an asterisk following each of the common authors' highest academic degrees in the author byline. Identify the asterisk at the end of the same page and state, "These authors contributed equally to the manuscript." Note that when working through the online submission process, however, only one author can be designated as the corresponding author.
  - The corresponding author must specify who conducted the statistical analysis with their professional affiliation (academic, governmental, or commercial) listed.
  - If applicable, the title page should indicate "Supplemental Data" below the authors' affiliations. All Supplemental Data and electronic file names should also be listed on the title page. Please note that Neurology no longer allows supplemental data except Teaching Slides, Videos, and manuscripts with tracked changes (revisions only).
  - If the article was previously posted on a preprint server, include a section on the title page labeled: “Publication history”. Please use the following as an example: “Publication history: This manuscript was previously published in bioRxiv: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/307798125”.
  -Provide a word count for the paper and abstract and a character count for the title (including spaces and punctuation).
  - Include number of references, tables, and figures. The Author and Co-investigator (if applicable) Appendices are excluded from word count.
  - If applicable, authors should indicate study sponsorship or funding by listing it on the title page: Study funding: Supported by NIH (OR 76675882).
  - Authors should choose a maximum of 5 search terms that cover the aspects of the submitted article. Please designate the term and include the number to which it corresponds.
  - The second page must mention study sponsorship or funding (industry, government, or institutional) and then disclosures of all authors' financial relationships deemed relevant to the manuscript. Authors will be notified at the appropriate time to complete an online disclosure with all financial relationships (and those of their immediate family members) from the past two years regardless of whether these relationships are related to the study described in the submitted manuscript. If the study period of the submitted manuscript exceeded two years, financial relationships relevant to the topic must also be disclosed. Seesample disclosure statement. Note that the disclosure must mention any corporate sponsorship of the study first and government or institutional funding second. No dollar amounts need to be included. Disclosures should appear in the same order as in the manuscript byline. Structure of sentences should be as similar as possible to the example. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that relevant disclosures appear on the submitted, revised, and final accepted manuscripts and that the page proofs reflect the author disclosures listed. Every author should be included in the Disclosure Statement. If an author has no relevant disclosures, please use "Dr. AUTHOR reports no disclosures." (Please note that COMPLETE disclosures must be included on the online disclosure form and will appear online exactly as entered.) Authors should review their disclosures for accuracy on a regular basis and update the disclosures form in their personal record as necessary.
  - Also see Appendix section below for author and/or coinvestigator listings in appendices (name, affiliation, role, contribution). These appendices are now required.
  
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary style="margin-left: 40px">Abstract</summary>
      <br>
  
Articles require structured abstracts that should not exceed 250 words (one double-spaced typed manuscript page). Abstracts should be lucid and readable; minimum statistics are sufficient. A structured abstract should be organized as follows:

1. Objective: In one sentence, state the hypothesis (‘e.g., to determine whether’) followed by the means by which it was tested.  Example: "Objective: To test the hypothesis that all frogs are made from cells, we dissected 42,000 frogs and performed histology on 5 organs, assuming this is as an adequate sample for generalizability."  If your study is exploratory, or hypothesis-generating, a statement to that effect should appear in the Objective section. 
2. Methods
3. Results
4. Conclusions
5. Classification of Evidence(required for studies of therapeutic interventions and diagnostic accuracy):
- Papers evaluated for classification of evidence must contain the section titled "Classification of Evidence" after the Conclusions section. In this section, please include the following in 25 words or less: "Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class [I, II, III, or IV] evidence that [Treatment] [reduces/increases/decreases/is well tolerated] results."
For example: “Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that certain dosages of mexiletine are well tolerated and effective in reducing handgrip relaxation.”
- This statement should be expanded to include other details in the Methods section.
- For Views/Reviews articles, provide a 150- to 250-word abstract, structured if possible. NeuroImages and Clinical/Scientific Notes do not require an abstract.

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Introduction</summary>
      <br>
  The introduction should not be more than 250 words. Be specific and concise in stating information related to the study. Refrain from reiterating known information.
  
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Methods</summary>
      <br>
- The Methods section must provide sufficient detail to allow replication of the study. As examples, the Methods should indicate nucleotide sequences used for RNA or DNA probes, what an antibody was made against and sources of antibodies, constructs for transgenic animals, and reagents and instruments used with the manufacturer's names and locations.

- If the study reports a therapeutic intervention (clinical trial or use of medication, procedure, maneuver, or change in patient environment intended to benefit the patient) or diagnostic accuracy, the Methods must be sufficiently detailed to allow Classification of Evidence.

- Papers evaluated for classification of evidence must contain a paragraph titled Classification of Evidence. In this paragraph, please state (a) the question(s) the investigation was designed to answer, specifically identifying the patient population, intervention of interest, and relevant outcomes; (b) the class of evidence (I, II, III, or IV) assigned to each question as determined by AAN criteria; and (c) a brief statement of the results of the study for each question. Detail dosages, percentages, years, and significance.

Examples:

- Classification of evidence: This interventional study provides Class I evidence that warfarin (target INR 1.7 to 2.5) is equivalent to aspirin 81 mg daily in preventing recurrent strokes during an average of 3 years of follow-up in participants aged 20 to 70 with a history of stroke (relative risk of stroke warfarin vs aspirin 0.98, 95% CIs 0.81 to 1.10).

- Methods/Primary research question: Has the introduction of adjunctive dexamethasone in the Netherlands improved outcome in pneumococcal meningitis? This study provides Class III evidence that dexamethasone reduced the proportion of participants with unfavorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of one to four) in the 2006-2009 cohort, as compared to the 1998-2002 cohort (39 vs. 50%; odds ratio, 0.63%; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.86; p=0.002). Mortality rates (20 vs. 30%; absolute risk difference, 10%; 95% confidence interval 4 to 17%; p=0.001) was also significantly lower in 2006-2009.

In a subsection on Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents, include the following:

- A statement of approval by an ethical standards committee on human experimentation (institutional or regional) for any experiments using human participants.
- A statement identifying the institutional or licensing committee approving experiments performed on live vertebrates and/or higher invertebrates.
- A statement that written informed consent was obtained from all participants (or guardians of participants) in the study (consent for research). For a retrospective analysis that is IRB-approved, state that approval from an ethical standards committee to conduct this study was received.
- A statement that authorization has been obtained for disclosure (consent-to-disclose) of any recognizable persons in photographs, videos, or other information that may be published in the Journal, in derivative works by the AAN, or on the Journal's Web site (when applicable).
- A statement, if the study reports on a clinical trial, providing the identity of the public trials registry and the clinical trial identifier number.
- Data Availability Policy

Neurology now requires a Data Availability statement to promote data transparency.  The statement must be included at the end of the Methods section of the article, under a separate subheading entitled “Data Availability Statement” or similar (see Author Center Policy area for details/further information).

To report previously published methods: In detail, summarize the previously published methods and insert citation. If you prefer to insert the previously published methods verbatim, please state: "We used the same methodology as the one employed in a previous study [citation]." Insert the published method verbatim immediately after the statement, citing it appropriately. If the verbatim wording is more than 200 words, supply permission to republish the content from the publisher of the original article.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Figures</summary>
      <br>
    
   Authors should examine a recent issue of Neurology to plan the appropriate layout and size when preparing their figures.

Neurology is interested in 3-D or interactive figures. If you have figures that would be enhanced by this approach, please let the editors know and include these as part of your submission.
- Proof of permission to reprint a figure from any source is required (as is permission to modify a figure, if applicable); figures previously published anywhere will not be published in Neurology without documented permission from the copyright holder.(Permissions should be uploaded as 'Additional Files' files at submission).
- Color figures are published at no charge to authors.
- Use Arial type within figures, capitalizing the first letters of first words of labels only. Ensure that the spacing between letters (kerning) is even (no letters closer together than the others) and that the lettering is crisp.
- Per Journal style, each figure has a short title above it (the detailed legend is placed under the figure). Provide a short title (15 words or less) for each figure at the beginning of the Figure Legend in the manuscript file.
- Title and Figure legends should be double-spaced and appear on a separate page at the end of the manuscript document file.
- Footnotes should be noted as superscript a, b, c, etc.
- Multipart figures should be labeled with capital letters A, B, C, (using Arial font) etc. in the upper left-hand corner of each panel. Please submit multipart figures as composite files. Panels should read from left to right, then down.
- In graphs, standard symbols should be used for data points in the following order: closed circle, closed square, closed triangle, closed diamond, open circle, open square, open triangle, open diamond. To prevent wasted space, axes should end no more than one increment beyond the final data points. Explanatory lettering should not extend beyond the ends of the axes.
- Remove extraneous lines from graphs.
- Line graphs should be solid colored lines rather than dots and dashes.
- Bar fill in bar graphs should be solid color rather than patterns.
-Figures should not include titles or patient initials. Titles should be placed in the figure legend, not on the figure itself. Abbreviation keys should be placed in the figure legend unless they fit into the confines of the figure.
- Internal scale markers must appear on microscopic photographs.
- Remove white type from MRIs, CTs, etc.
- To avoid perspective confusion, right and left sides of axial and coronal images must be marked appropriately with and R for right and/or L for left.
- Number figures in the order of their mention in the text.
For supported electronic file requirements, see the section on Electronic Figure and Video Submission.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary>Tables</summary>
      <br>
  Tables should be created using the table function in Word and included as part of the manuscript document file. Do not embed image files of tables and do not use tabs in creating tables. Authors should consult a recent issue of Neurology before designing tables.

- Tables should be brief and easily understood without referring to the text.
- Do not use color or shading within tables.
- Do not include patient names or initials in the tables.
- Place each table, including a title and legend (if applicable), on a separate page at the end of the manuscript file.
- All tables must be double-spaced.
- Number tables in the order of their mention in the text.
- References cited within a table should use numbers rather than author names.
- Tables should be no longer than two double-spaced manuscript pages.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> Appendices </summary>
      <br>
    
  
Authors are required to include an Appendix 1 that lists names, locations, and contributions of all authors in a tabular format. This table should be placed before the references. Authors should appear in the order they appear in the byline. For articles with a study group, include an Appendix 2 that lists co-investigator names, locations, roles, and contributions. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that these appendices appear on the submitted, revised, and final accepted manuscripts and that the page proofs reflect the information listed.

      <summary> Supplemental Data: Neurology </summary>
      <br>

Effective March 1, 2018, Neurology revised the supplemental data guidelines. Authors of Neurology research articles are advised to reduce the use of supplemental data and incorporate this content into the manuscript as we have increased length restrictions. If the author has not done this and the article is invited for revision, the editorial office may request deposit of data in an open repository such as Dryad.

Videos, Teaching NeuroImage PowerPoints, and Manuscripts with tracked changes (revisions only) files will still be uploaded as Supplemental data.

- Supplemental Data: Neurology: Clinical Practice, Neurology: Genetics, and Neurology: Neurioimmunology & Neuroinflammation
- Supplemental data (also referred to as web data) are materials such as tables, figures, references, and videos, that are submitted for review and consideration for publication with the online version of the article. All supplemental files intended for publication should be uploaded with the initial submission, labeled appropriately, and cited properly (see below) within the document. Before submission, carefully review all information because it will not be read by a professional copyeditor. Neurology and the publisher (Wolters Kluwer) are not responsible for errors or omissions contained in data supplements. Accepted formats include Adobe PDF, GIF, HTML, JPG, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and Plain text. Files may be compressed using the ZIP® compression utility. Please label your files and cite (within the manuscript text) in the following way:

 -Tables: table e-1, table e-2, table e-3...

- Figures: figure e-1, figure e-2, figure e-3...

- Appendices: appendix e-1, appendix e-2, appendix e-3...

- Videos: video 1, video 2, video 3...

- References: e-References. e1, e2, e3...

Any type of data not listed here can be listed by the full name (e.g., Acknowledgment, Questionnaire) preceded by e., e.g., e-Questionnaire.

Supplemental table and figure legends should be included on the same pages as the tables and figures themselves. All supplemental data, including references, should be uploaded separately from the manuscript itself.
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Additional Files </summary>
      <br>

Additional Files include documents that will not appear online if the article is published but are necessary for the review process. Examples of Additional Files  include checklists, patient consent forms, in-press articles, and license-to-publish forms for those authors opting for open access publication. When uploading Additional Files, you will be prompted to label them. Please label them the same as the file name if possible (see above bulleted list) or by form name (e.g., CONSORT, in-press reference 7).

Please remember that the larger the file size, the longer it will take for users to download; therefore, whenever possible, optimize your graphics files for online publication by reviewing the information included with the application in which you have saved the graphics so that you are providing the most compressed file size possible. Files should be no larger than 13 MB.
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> References </summary>
      <br>

- Cite references in numerical order according to their position in the Reference list in the text.
- List all authors when there are six or fewer; for seven or more, list only the first three and add "et al."
- Use PubMed abbreviations for journal names but eliminate U.S. cities cited in parentheses after the name of a journal.
- Use continuous pagination (e.g., 33-37, not 33-7).
- Do not reference papers that are "submitted" to another journal; unpublished papers must be accepted and in-press so they can be properly cited.
- Authors must provide "submitted" and "in-press" manuscripts clearly labeled as such by uploading them as "Additional files" at submission.
- Personal communications should be mentioned in the body of the manuscript (not in the references). The author must state in writing in the cover letter of the submission that permission was obtained by the author of any personal communication cited in the article.
- Neurology reference style is similar to the style described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, with the exception that pagination should be complete. The following are sample styles for submission. - See the Uniform Requirements for guidance on other reference types.

   <details>
      <summary> Acknowledgments </summary>
      <br>


The Acknowledgments section allows authors space to recognize and express appreciation to others who have contributed to the study but do not qualify as Authors or Coinvestigators. In this section, list those who have collected data; provided technical assistance; acquired funding; supervised personnel; contributed drugs, reagents, equipment, or study participants; or edited the manuscript for non-intellectual content. The list must include the contributors' affiliations and the specific contributions made by each. The Acknowledgment section is also reserved for authors to thank individuals who have provided general advice or guidance, review of the manuscript, and technical help. For those helping in preparation of the manuscript, please specify how they assisted (e.g., performed substantive or technical editing, copyedited the manuscript, prepared tables or figures, or provided clerical assistance).

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Figures: For Review Purposes </summary>
      <br>

- For maximum quality, figures should be developed as separate files in an approved format and should not be embedded in the text document. Upload each figure as a separate Image File, not as part of the manuscript file.
- Composite figures (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D) should be submitted as a single, composite file.
- JPG , PPT, PDF, and GIF files may be submitted for review purposes only. Multi-page Power Point (.ppt) files are not supported, but one slide per file is acceptable for review purposes.
- If the manuscript is invited for revision, you will be asked to upload, as supplemental files, the original figures in the program in which they were created.
- If the manuscript is accepted, EPS or TIF files for digital art will be required.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Figure: At Acceptance </summary>
      <br>

- If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the author will be required to submit print-quality electronic files for all art that will appear in the printed article.
- If fonts are used in the artwork, they must be converted to paths or outlines or they must be embedded in the files.
- Electronic art must be submitted as either a TIF (tagged image file format) or an EPS(encapsulated postscript) file.
- Crop and size images properly before importing them.
- Line art (graphs, charts, pedigrees) must have a resolution of at least 1200 dpi (dots per inch).
- Half-tones (radiographs, CT scans) must have a resolution of at least 600 dpi.
- Combination half-tones (CT scan with lines or fonts) or any color photographs must have a resolution of at least 600 dpi.
- Files containing color photographs should include the word "color" in the file name. Combination color with lines or fonts should have a resolution of at least 600 dpi.
- Color art should be saved as CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) images.
- Images to appear in black and white must be saved as a grayscale image (not as CMYK).
- Formats not supported include: files utilizing OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) technology to display information or embed files, .bmp, .pict, .xls, .psd, .cnv, .cdr and locked or encrypted .pdfs.
- Artwork downloaded from the Internet (JPG or GIF files) will not be accepted for publication.
- Authors who are unable to provide figures in an approved electronic format must follow the conventional submission guidelines in the Neurology Information for Authors.
  
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Video Format </summary>
      <br>

Submit videos as separate supplemental files with your original manuscript submission.
- A brief description of each video, titled "Video legend," should be uploaded as a separate supplemental file.
- Videos should be named in the order of their text citation (e.g., video1.mov). If a video is directly related to a figure or table, name it accordingly (e.g., Fig4video3.mov). Avoid lengthy file names.
- Preferred video formats include .wmv, .mpg, and .mov files. To create high-quality video for the Web at small file sizes, download the free Windows Media Encoder.
- Authors are responsible for obtaining patient consent forms for any figures of identifiable participants and should edit out any names mentioned in the recording. The consent form should indicate specific use (reproduction in the medical literature in print and online, with the understanding that participants and the public will have access) of the participant’s medical information and any images and must contain the participant’s signature or that of a legal guardian. The original form must be retained by the corresponding author. The Corresponding Author must declare in the cover letter that the participant signed the consent form.
- Windows Media files can be seen by users on all computers, but the tool to create the files can only be used on Windows machines. For those authors who work on Macs, QuickTime creates good high-quality files, but authors should be careful to select options that keep file sizes small. If the author can create the video as an .mpg file, this will work for all users and result in a compressed file size.
- Videos must be no larger than 20 MB. 
- Color depth should be kept to a minimum, using grayscale for black and white videos.
- Frame size should be limited to 640x480 or 720x480 pixels for best viewing within a browser on most monitors. If necessary, split the video into several clips

In the manuscript, include a separate section called "Key Points" before the Abstract.

This feature provides a quick structured synopsis of the findings of your manuscript (required only for research and review manuscripts), following 3 key points: Question, Findings, and Meaning. Limit this section to 75-100 words or less.

1. Question: Focused question based on the study hypothesis or goal/purpose. Limit to 1 sentence.

2. Findings: Results of the study/review. Include the design (eg, clinical trial, cohort study, case-control study, meta-analysis). Focus on primary outcome(s) and finding(s). Do not emphasize secondary outcomes. Report basic numbers only but state if results are statistically significant or not significant; do not include results of statistical tests or measures of variance (see example below). Can include 1 to 2 sentences.

3. Meaning: Key conclusion and implication based on the primary finding(s). Limit to 1 sentence.

Example of Research Article

- Question: What is the immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza A vaccine with and without adjuvant?

- Findings: In this randomized clinical trial that included 980 adults, the proportion achieving an effective antibody response was 84% with adjuvant vs 2% without adjuvant, a significant difference.

- Meaning: In an influenza pandemic the use of an adjuvant with inactivated influenza A vaccine may be warranted.

- Question: What are the most effective medical treatments for adult chronic sinusitis?

- Findings: In this systematic review, symptoms of chronic sinusitis were improved with saline irrigation and topical corticosteroid therapy compared to no therapy. Compared with placebo, 3-week courses of systemic corticosteroids or oral doxycycline were associated with reduced polyp size, and a 3-month course of macrolide antibiotic was associated with improved symptoms in patients without polyps.

- Meaning: First-line therapy for chronic sinusitis should begin with daily topical intranasal corticosteroid in conjunction with saline irrigation; subsequent therapies should be based on the patient's polyp status and severity of symptoms.

     <summary> Abstracts </summary>
     <br>


Include a structured abstract for reports of original data, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Abstracts should be prepared in JAMA Network style—see instructions for preparing abstracts below. Abstracts are not required for Editorials, Viewpoints, and special features. No information should be reported in the abstract that does not appear in the text of the manuscript.

- Abstracts for Reports of Original Data:
Reports of original data should include an abstract of no more than 350 words using the headings listed below. For brevity, parts of the abstract may be written as phrases rather than complete sentences. Each section should include the following content:

1. Importance: The abstract should begin with a sentence or 2 explaining the clinical (or other) importance of the study question.

2. Objective: State the precise objective or study question addressed in the report (eg, "To determine whether..."). If more than 1 objective is addressed, the main objective should be indicated and only key secondary objectives stated. If an a priori hypothesis was tested, it should be stated.

3. Design: Describe the basic design of the study and include the specific study type (eg, randomized clinical trial, cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, case series, survey, meta-analysis, bibliometric analysis). State the years of the study and the duration of follow-up. For older studies (eg, those completed >3 years ago), add the date of the analysis being reported. If applicable, include the name of the study (eg, the Framingham Heart Study). As relevant, indicate whether observers were blinded to patient groupings, particularly for subjective measurements.

4. Setting: Describe the study setting to assist readers to determine the applicability of the report to other circumstances, for example, multicenter, population-based, primary care or referral center(s), etc.

5. Participants: State the clinical disorders, important eligibility criteria, and key sociodemographic features of patients (or other study participants). The numbers of eligible participants and how they were selected should be provided, including the number approached but who refused or were excluded. For selection procedures, these terms should be used, if appropriate: random sample (where random refers to a formal, randomized selection in which all eligible individuals have a fixed and usually equal chance of selection); population-based sample; referred sample; consecutive sample; volunteer sample; convenience sample. If matching is used for comparison groups, characteristics that are matched should be specified. In follow-up studies, the proportion of participants who completed the study must be indicated.

Note: The preceding 3 sections are usually combined for accepted papers during the editing process as "Design, Setting, and Participants," but for manuscript submission these sections should be kept separate.

6. Intervention(s) (for clinical trials) or Exposure(s) (for observational studies): The essential features of any interventions, or exposures, should be described, including their method and duration. The intervention, or exposure, should be named by its most common clinical name, and nonproprietary drug names should be used.

7. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Indicate the primary study outcome measurement(s) as planned before data collection began. If the manuscript does not report the main planned outcomes of a study, this fact should be stated and the reason indicated. State clearly if the hypothesis being tested was formulated during or after data collection. Explain outcomes or measurements unfamiliar to a general medical readership.

8. Results: Summary demographic information (eg, characteristics such as sex and age) and the number of study participants should be reported in the first sentence of the Results paragraph. The main outcomes of the study should be reported and quantified, including final included/analyzed sample. When possible, present numerical results (eg, absolute numbers and/or rates) with appropriate indicators of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals. Use means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data and medians and ranges or interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that are not normally distributed. Avoid solely reporting the results of statistical hypothesis testing, such as P values, which fail to convey important quantitative information. For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. See also Reporting Standards and Data Presentation. Measures of relative risk also may be reported (eg, relative risk, hazard ratios) and should include confidence intervals. Studies of screening and diagnostic tests should report sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio. If predictive value or accuracy is reported, prevalence or pretest likelihood should be given as well. All randomized clinical trials should include the results of intention-to-treat analysis as well. In intervention studies, the number of patients withdrawn because of adverse effects should be given. Approaches such as number needed to treat to achieve a unit of benefit may be included when appropriate. All surveys should include response/participation rates.

9. Conclusions and Relevance: Provide only conclusions of the study that are directly supported by the results. Give equal emphasis to positive and negative findings of equal scientific merit. Also, provide a statement of relevance indicating implications for clinical practice or health policy, avoiding speculation and overgeneralization. The relevance statement may also indicate whether additional study is required before the information should be used in clinical settings.

10. Trial Registration: For clinical trials only (not nontrial observational studies), the name of the trial registry, registration number, and URL of the registry must be included. See Trial Registration.


- Abstracts for Meta-analysis:
Manuscripts reporting the results of meta-analyses should include an abstract of no more than 350 words using the headings listed below. The text of the manuscript should also include a section describing the methods used for data sources, study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. Each heading should be followed by a brief description:

1. Importance: A sentence or 2 explaining the importance of the systematic review question that is used to justify the meta-analysis.

2. Objective: State the precise primary objective of the meta-analysis. Indicate whether the systematic review for the meta-analysis emphasizes factors such as cause, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or prevention and include information about the specific population, intervention, exposure, and tests or outcomes that are being analyzed.

3. Data Sources: Succinctly summarize data sources, including years searched. The search should include the most current information possible, ideally with the search being conducted within several months before the date of manuscript submission. Potential sources include computerized databases and published indexes, registries, meeting abstracts, conference proceedings, references identified from bibliographies of pertinent articles and books, experts or research institutions active in the field, and companies or manufacturers of tests or agents being reviewed. If a bibliographic database is used, state the exact indexing terms used for article retrieval, including any constraints (for example, English language or human study participants). If abstract space does not permit this level of detail, summarize sources in the abstract including databases and years searched, and place the remainder of the information in the Methods section.

4. Study Selection: Describe inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select studies for detailed review from among studies identified as relevant to the topic. Details of selection should include particular populations, interventions, outcomes, or methodological designs. The method used to apply these criteria should be specified (for example, blinded review, consensus, multiple reviewers). State the proportion of initially identified studies that met selection criteria.

5. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Describe guidelines (eg, PRISMA, MOOSE) used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. The method by which the guidelines were applied should be stated (for example, independent extraction by multiple observers). Indicate whether data were pooled using a fixed-effect or random-effects model.

6. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Indicate the primary study outcome(s) and measurement(s) as planned before data collection began. If the manuscript does not report the main planned outcomes of a study, this fact should be stated and the reason indicated. State clearly if the hypothesis being tested was formulated during or after data collection. Explain outcomes or measurement unfamiliar to a general medical readership.

7. Results: Provide the number of studies and patients/participants in the analysis and state the main quantitative results of the review. When possible, present numerical results (eg, absolute numbers and/or rates) with appropriate indicators of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals. Use means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data and medians and ranges or interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that are not normally distributed. Avoid solely reporting the results of statistical hypothesis testing, such as P values, which fail to convey important quantitative information. For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. See also Reporting Standards and Data Presentation. Meta-analyses should state the major outcomes that were pooled and include odds ratios or effect sizes and, if possible, sensitivity analyses. Evaluations of screening and diagnostic tests should include sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, receiver operating characteristic curves, and predictive values. Assessments of prognosis should summarize survival characteristics and related variables. Major identified sources of variation between studies should be stated, including differences in treatment protocols, co-interventions, confounders, outcome measures, length of follow-up, and dropout rates.

8. Conclusions and Relevance: The conclusions and their applications (clinical or otherwise) should be clearly stated, limiting interpretation to the domain of the review.



- Abstracts for Systematic Reviews:
Systematic Review articles should include a structured abstract of no more than 350 words using the headings listed below.

1. Importance: Include 1 or 2 sentences describing the clinical question or issue and its importance in clinical practice or public health.

2. Objective: State the precise primary objective of the review. Indicate whether the review emphasizes factors such as cause, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or prevention and include information about the specific population, intervention, exposure, and tests or outcomes that are being reviewed.

3. Evidence Review: Describe the information sources used, including the search strategies, years searched, and other sources of material, such as subsequent reference searches of retrieved articles. Methods used for inclusion of identified articles and quality assessment should be explained.

4. Findings: Include a brief summary of the number of articles included, numbers of various types of studies (eg, clinical trials, cohort studies), and numbers of patients/participants represented by these studies. Summarize the major findings of the review of the clinical issue or topic in an evidence-based, objective, and balanced fashion, with the highest-quality evidence available receiving the greatest emphasis. Provide quantitative data.

5. Conclusions and Relevance: The conclusions should clearly answer the questions posed if applicable, be based on available evidence, and emphasize how clinicians should apply current knowledge. Conclusions should be based only on results described in the abstract Findings subsection.

6. Abstracts for Narrative Reviews:
Narrative Review articles should include a 3-part structured abstract of no more than 300 words using the headings listed below:

7. Importance: An overview of the topic and discussion of the main objective or reason for this review.

8. Observations: The principal observations and findings of the review.

9. Conclusions and Relevance: The conclusions of the review that are supported by the information, along with clinical applications. How the findings are clinically relevant should be specifically stated.

     <summary> Ratings for quality of the evidence </summary>
     <br>


Tables summarizing evidence should include ratings of the quality of the evidence. Use the rating scheme listed below with ratings of 1-5 for Reviews that include individual studies (modified from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine for ratings of individual studies).
Quality Rating Scheme for Studies and Other Evidence
1	Properly powered and conducted randomized clinical trial; systematic review with meta-analysis
2	Well-designed controlled trial without randomization; prospective comparative cohort trial
3	Case-control studies; retrospective cohort study
4	Case series with or without intervention; cross-sectional study
5	Opinion of respected authorities; case reports
There are several other preferred systems for rating the quality of evidence in Review articles. For Reviews that synthesize findings from numerous studies into a single summary recommendation, use the rating scale shown above or the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine's Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendation or the recommendations in the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. For reviews that include diagnostic studies, use The Rational Clinical Examination Levels of Evidence table.

Follow additional instructions for preparation and submission of Tables.

        <summary> General Considerations </summary>
        <br>
    
Authors are encouraged to consult "Reporting Statistical Information in Medical Journal Articles."1 In the Methods section, describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to reproduce the reported results. Such description should include appropriate references to the original literature, particularly for uncommon statistical methods. For more advanced or novel methods, provide a brief explanation of the methods and appropriate use in the text and consider providing a detailed description in an online supplement.

In the reporting of results, when possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty, such as confidence intervals (see Reporting Standards and Data Presentation). Avoid relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of P values, which fails to convey important quantitative information. For observational studies, provide the numbers of observations. For randomized trials, provide the numbers randomized. Report losses to observation or follow up (see Missing Data). For multivariable models, report all variables included in models, and report model diagnostics and overall fit of the model when available (see Statistical Procedures).

Define statistical terms, abbreviations, and symbols, if included. Avoid nontechnical uses of technical terms in statistics, such as correlation, normal, predictor, random, sample, significant, trend. Do not use inappropriate hedge terms such as marginal significance or trend toward significance for results that are not statistically significant. Causal language (including use of terms such as effect and efficacy) should be used only for randomized clinical trials. For all other study designs (including meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials), methods and results should be described in terms of association or correlation and should avoid cause-and-effect wording.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Sample Size Calculations </summary>
      <br>


For randomized trials, a statement of the power or sample size calculation is required (see the EQUATOR Network CONSORT Guidelines). For observational studies that use an established population, a power calculation is not generally required when the sample size is fixed. However, if the sample size was determined by the researchers, through any type of sampling or matching, then there should be some justification for the number sampled. In any case, describe power and sample size calculations at the beginning of the Statistical Methods section, following the general description of the study population.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Descriptive Statistics </summary>
      <br>

It is generally not necessary to provide a detailed description of the methods used to generate summary statistics, but the tests should be briefly noted in the Methods section (eg, ANOVA or Fisher exact test).

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Statistical Procedures </summary>
      <br>


Identify regression models with more than 1 independent variable as multivariable and regression models with more than 1 dependent variable as multivariate. Report all variables included in models, as well as any mathematical transformations of those variables. Provide the scientific rationale (clinical, statistical, or otherwise) for including variables in regression models.

For regression models fit to dependent data (eg, clustered or longitudinal data), the models should account for the correlations that arise from clustering and/or repeated measures. Failure to account for such correlation will result in incorrect estimates of uncertainty (eg, confidence intervals). Describe how the model accounted for correlation. For example, for an analysis based on generalized estimating equations, identify the assumed correlation structure and whether robust (or, sandwich) variance estimators were used. Or, for an analysis based on mixed-effects models, identify the assumed structure for the random effects, such as the level of random intercepts and whether any random slopes were included. Fixed-effects estimation should be described as conditional likelihood. Avoid the term fixed effects for describing covariates.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Missing Data </summary>
      <br>
Report losses to observation, such as dropouts from a clinical trial or those lost to follow-up or unavailable in an observational study. If some participants are excluded from analyses because of missing or incomplete data, provide a supplementary table that compares the observed characteristics between participants with complete and incomplete data. Consider multiple imputation methods to impute missing data and include an assessment of whether data were missing at random. Approaches based on "last observation carried forward" should not be used.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Primary Outcomes, Multiple Comparisons, and Post Hoc Comparisons </summary>
      <br>


Both randomized and observational studies should identify the primary outcome(s) before the study began, as well as any prespecified secondary, subgroup, and/or sensitivity analyses. Comparisons arrived at during the course of the analysis or after the study was completed should be identified as post hoc. For analyses of more than 1 primary outcome, corrections for multiple testing should generally be used. For secondary outcomes, address multiple comparisons or consider such analyses as exploratory and interpret them as hypothesis-generating. The reporting of all outcomes should match that included in study protocols. For randomized clinical trials, protocols with complete statistical analysis plans should be cited in the Methods section and submitted as online supplementary content (see Reporting Clinical Trials). Randomized clinical trials should be primarily analyzed according to the intention-to-treat approach. Deviations from strict intention-to-treat analysis should be described as "modified intention-to-treat," with the modifications clearly described.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Statistical Analysis Subsection</summary>
      <br>

At the end of the Methods section, briefly describe the statistical tests used for the analysis. State any a priori levels of significance and whether hypothesis tests were 1- or 2-sided. Also include the statistical software used to perform the analysis, including the version and manufacturer, along with any extension packages (eg, the svy suite of commands in Stata or the survival package in R). Do not describe software commands (eg, SAS proc mixed was used to fit a linear mixed-effects model). If analysis code is included, it should be placed in the online supplementary content.

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Repsorting Standards and Data Preparation </summary>
      <br>

Analyses should follow EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines and be consistent with the protocol and statistical analysis plan, or described as post hoc.

When possible, present numerical results (eg, absolute numbers and/or rates) with appropriate indicators of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals. Use means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data and medians and ranges or interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that are not normally distributed. Avoid solely reporting the results of statistical hypothesis testing, such as P values, which fail to convey important quantitative information. For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. If P values are reported, follow standard conventions for decimal places: for P values less than .001, report as "P<.001"; for P values between .001 and .01, report the value to the nearest thousandth; for P values greater than or equal to .01, report the value to the nearest hundredth; and for P values greater than .99, report as "P>.99." For studies with exponentially small P values (eg, genetic association studies), P values may be reported with exponents (eg, P = 1×10−5). In general, there is no need to present the values of test statistics (eg, F statistics or χ² results) and degrees of freedom when reporting results.

For secondary and subgroup analyses, there should be a description of how the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons was handled, for example, by adjustment of the significance threshold. In the absence of some approach, these analyses should generally be described and interpreted as exploratory, as should all post hoc analyses.

For randomized trials using parallel-group design, there is no validity in conducting hypothesis tests regarding the distribution of baseline covariates between groups; by definition, these differences are due to chance. Because of this, tables of baseline participant characteristics should not include P values or statements of statistical comparisons among randomized groups. Instead, report clinically meaningful imbalances between groups, along with potential adjustments for those imbalances in multivariable models.

      <summary> Tables and Figures </summary>
      <br>

Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain and support the argument of the article and to report all outcomes identified in the Methods section. Number each table and figure and provide a descriptive title for each. Every table and figure should have an in-text citation. Verify that data are consistently reported across text, tables, figures, and supplementary material.



Frequency data should be reported as "No. (%)," not as percentages alone (exception, sample sizes exceeding ~10,000). Whenever possible, proportions and percentages should be accompanied by the actual numerator and denominator from which they were derived. This is particularly important when the sample size is less than 100. Do not use decimal places (ie, xx%, not xx.xx%) if the sample size is less than 100. Tables that include results from multivariable regression models should focus on the primary results. Provide the unadjusted and adjusted results for the primary exposure(s) or comparison(s) of interest. If a more detailed description of the model is required, consider providing the additional unadjusted and adjusted results in supplementary tables.

Tables have a minimum of 2 columns. Comparisons must read across the table columns.

Do not duplicate data in figures and tables. For all primary outcomes noted in the Methods section, exact values with measures of uncertainty should be reported in the text or in a table and in the Abstract, and not only represented graphically in figures.

Pie charts and 3-D graphs should not be used and should be revised to alternative graph types.

Bar graphs should be used to present frequency data only (ie, numbers and rates). Avoid stacked bar charts and consider alternative formats (eg, tables or splitting bar segments into side-by-side bars) except for comparisons of distributions of ordinal data.

Summary data (eg, means, odds ratios) should be reported using data markers for point estimates, not bars, and should include error bars indicating measures of uncertainty (eg, SDs, 95% CIs). Actual values (not log-transformed values) of relative data (for example, odds ratios, hazard ratios) should be plotted on log scales.

For survival plots, include the number at risk for each group included in the analysis at intervals along the x-axis scale. For any figures in which color is used, be sure that colors are distinguishable.

All symbols, indicators, line styles, and colors in statistical graphs should be defined in a key or in the figure legend. Axes in statistical graphs must have labels. Units of measure must be provided for continuous data.

Note: All figures are re-created by journal graphics experts according to reporting standards using the JAMA Network style guide and color palette.
    
   <details>
     <summary> Tables </summary>
      <br>
Number all tables in the order of their citation in the text.
Include a brief title for each table (a descriptive phrase, preferably no longer than 10 to 15 words).
Include all tables at the end of the manuscript file.
Refer to Categories of Articles for limits on the number of tables.
NOTE: Do not embed tables as images in the manuscript file or upload tables in image formats, and do not upload tables as separate files.
  
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary> Table Creation </summary>
      <br>
Use the table menu in the software program used to prepare the text. Tables can be built de novo using Insert→Table or copied into the text file from another document (eg, Word, Excel, or a statistical spreadsheet).

Avoid using tabs, spaces, and hard returns to set up the table; such tables will have to be retyped, creating delays and opportunities for error.

Tables should be single-spaced and in a 10- or 12-point font (do not shrink the point size to fit the table onto the page). Do not draw extra lines or rules—the table grid will display the outlines of each cell.

Each piece of data needs to be contained in its own cell. Do not try to align cells with hard returns or tabs; alignment will be imposed in the production system if the paper is accepted. Although individual empty cells are acceptable in a table, be sure there are no empty columns. To show an indent, add 2 spaces.

When presenting percentages, include numbers (numerator and denominator).

Include statistical variability where applicable (eg, mean [SD], median [IQR]). For additional detail on requirements for data presentation in tables, see Statistical Methods and Data Presentation.

Place each row of data in a separate row of cells, and note that No. (%) and measures of variability are presented in the same cell as in the example Table 1 below:

Table 1. Baseline Values in the Editors' Health Study

SI conversion factors: To convert cholesterol to mmol/L, multiply values by 0.0259.

Note that JAMA Network journals report laboratory values in conventional units. In a table, provide a footnote with the conversion factor to SI units. For a calculator of SI and conventional units, see the AMA Manual of Style.2

To present data that span more than 1 row, merge the cells vertically. For example, in Table 2 the final column presents the P value for overall age comparisons.

Table 2. Blood Pressure Values Stratified by Age

The table should be constructed such that the primary comparison reads horizontally. For example, see Table 3 (incorrect) and Table 4 (correct).

Table 3. Patient Data by Study Group

Table 4. Patient Data by Study Group

If a table must be continued, repeat the title and column headings on the second page, followed by "(continued)."

Table Footnotes
Footnotes to tables may apply to the entire table, portions (eg, a column), or an individual entry.

The order of the footnotes is determined by the placement in the table of the item to which the footnote refers.

When both a footnote letter and reference number follow data in a table, set the superscript reference number first followed by a comma and the superscript letter.

Use superscript letters (a, b, c) to mark each footnote and be sure each footnote in the table has a corresponding note (and vice versa).

List abbreviations in the footnote section and explain any empty cells.

If relevant, add a footnote to explain why numbers may not sum to group totals or percentages do not add to 100%.

For more detail on the components and recommended structure of tables, see the AMA Manual of Style.2

      <summary> Figures </summary>
      <br>


Number all figures (graphs, charts, photographs, and illustrations) in the order of their citation in the text. The number of figures should be limited. Avoid complex composite or multipart figures unless justified. See Categories of Articles for limits on the number of figures and/or tables according to article type.

For initial manuscript submissions, figures must be of sufficient quality and may be embedded at the end of the file for editorial assessment and peer review. If a revision is requested and before a manuscript is accepted, authors will be asked to provide figures that meet the requirements described in Figure File Requirements for Publication.

Graphs, charts, some illustrations, titles, legends, keys, and other elements related to figures in accepted manuscripts will be re-created and edited according to JAMA Network style and standards prior to publication. Online-only figures will not be edited or re-created (see Online-Only Supplements and Multimedia).

   <details>
      <summary> Image Integrity </summary>
      <br>


Preparation of scientific images (clinical images, radiographic images, micrographs, gels, etc) for publication must preserve the integrity of the image data. Digital adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color applied uniformly to an entire image are permissible as long as these adjustments do not selectively highlight, misrepresent, obscure, or eliminate specific elements in the original figure, including the background. Selective adjustments applied to individual elements in an image are not permissible. Individual elements may not be moved within an image field, deleted, or inserted from another image. Cropping may be used for efficient image display or to deidentify patients but must not misrepresent or alter interpretation of the image by selectively eliminating relevant visual information. Juxtaposition of elements from different parts of a single image or from different images, as in a composite, must be clearly indicated by the addition of dividing lines, borders, and/or panel labels.

When inappropriate image adjustments are detected by the journal staff, authors will be asked for an explanation and will be requested to submit the image as originally captured prior to any adjustment, cropping, or labeling. Authors may be asked to resubmit the image prepared in accordance with the above standards.

      <summary> Accepatable Figure Files for Initial Submission and Review </summary>
      <br>


Each figure for the main article may be uploaded as a separate file or appended to the end of the manuscript with the figure titles and legends. Online-only figures must be combined into the PDF of the online-only supplement (see Online-Only Supplements and Multimedia). Note: If a revision is requested and before acceptance, authors must upload each figure for the main article as a separate file and follow the instructions in Figure File Requirements for Publication.

See the Table of Figure Requirements for additional guidance for specific types of figures for suggested resolution and file formats. In general each figure should be no larger than 1 MB.

      <summary> Figure File Requirements for Publication </summary>
      <br>


Each figure for the main article must be uploaded as a separate file. Online-only figures must be combined into the PDF of the online-only supplement (see Online-Only Supplements and Multimedia).

See the Table of Figure Requirements for additional guidance and file formats for specific types of figures.

Files created by vector programs are best for accurately plotting and maintaining data points. JAMA Network journals are unable to use file formats native to statistical software applications to prepare figures for publication; most statistical software programs allow users to save or export files in digital vector formats.

Images created digitally (by digital camera or electronically created illustrations) must meet the minimum resolution requirements at the time of creation. Electronically increasing the resolution of an image after creation causes a breakdown of detail and will result in an unacceptable poor-quality image. Each component of a composite image must be uploaded separately at submission and individually meet the minimum resolution requirement.

Color photographs should be submitted in RGB mode using profiles such as Adobe RGB or sRGB. Digital cameras capture images in RGB. Do not change any color settings once the file is on the computer. Black-and-white photographs (eg, radiographs, ultrasound images, CT and MRI scans, and electron micrographs) can be submitted in either RGB or grayscale modes.

   <details>
      <summary> Figure Titles and Legends (Captions) </summary>
      <br>

At the end of the manuscript, include a title for each figure. The figure title should be a brief descriptive phrase, preferably no longer than 10 to 15 words. A figure legend (caption) can be used for a brief explanation of the figure or markers if needed and expansion of abbreviations. For photomicrographs, include the type of specimen, original magnification or a scale bar, and stain in the legend. For gross pathology specimens, label any rulers with unit of measure. Digitally enhanced images must be clearly identified in the figure legends as enhanced or manipulated, eg, computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance images, photographs, photomicrographs, x-ray films.

   <details>
      <summary> Figures with Labels, Arrows, or other Markers </summary>
      <br>

Photographs, clinical images, photomicrographs, gel electrophoresis, and other types that include labels, arrows, or other markers must be submitted in 2 versions: one version with the markers and one without. Provide an explanation for all labels, arrows, or other markers in the figure legend. The Figure field in the File Description tab of the manuscript submission system allows for uploading of 2 versions of the same figure.

     <summary> General Figure Guidelines </summary>
     <br>
Primary outcome data should not be presented in figures alone. Exact values with measure of variability should be reported in the text or table as well as in the abstract.
All symbols, indicators (including error bars), line styles, colors, and abbreviations should be defined in a legend.
Each axis on a statistical graph must have a label and units of measure should be labeled.
Do not use pie charts, 3-D graphs, and stacked bar charts as these are not appropriate for accurate statistical presentation of data and should be revised to another figure type or converted to a table.
Error bars should be included in both directions, unless only 1-sided variability was calculated.
Values for ratio data—odds ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios—should be plotted on a log scale. Values for ratio data should not be log transformed.
For footnotes, use letters (a, b, c, etc) not symbols.
Do not submit figures with more than 4 panels unless otherwise justified.
For images featuring patients or other identifiable persons, it is not acceptable to use black bars across the eyes in an attempt to deidentify. Cropping may be acceptable as long as the condition under discussion is clearly visible and necessary anatomic landmarks display. If the person in the image is possibly identifiable (not only by others but also by her/himself), permission for publication is required (see Patient Identification).

Figure Type	Correct Usage and Creation
Bar graph


To present frequency data (numbers or percentages). Each bar represents a category.

Bar graphs are typically vertical but when categories have long titles or there are many of them, they may run horizontally.

The scale on the frequency axis should begin at 0, and the axis should not be broken.

If the data plotted are a percentage or rate, error bars may be used to show statistical variability.

     <br>

Authors may submit supporting material to accompany their article for online-only publication when there is insufficient space to include the material in the print article. This material should be important to the understanding and interpretation of the report and should not repeat material in the print article. The amount of online-only material should be limited and justified. Online-only material should be original and not previously published.

Online-only material will undergo editorial and peer review with the main manuscript. If the manuscript is accepted for publication and if the online-only material is deemed appropriate for publication by the editors, it will be posted online at the time of publication of the article as additional material provided by the authors. This material will not be edited or formatted; thus, authors are responsible for the accuracy and presentation of all such material.

Online-only material should be submitted in a single Word document with pages numbered consecutively. Each element included in the online-only material should be cited in the text of the main manuscript (eg, eTable in the Supplement) and numbered in order of citation in the text (eg, eTable 1, eTable 2, eFigure 1, eFigure 2, eMethods). The first page of the online-only document should list the number and title of each element included in the document.

   <details>
      <summary> Online Only Text </summary>
      <br>
Online-only text should be set in Times New Roman font, 10 point in size, and single-spaced. The main heading of the online-only text should be in 12 point and boldface; subheadings should be in 10 point and boldface.

If compression is required to reduce file size for uploading, please use a minimum bit rate of 10,000 kbit/s – 20,000 kbit/s
When filming, please use a landscape orientation, not a portrait orientation. This is especially important when filming video or taking photographs with a smartphone or a mobile device.
Verify that the videos are viewable in QuickTime or Windows Media Player before uploading.

For each video, provide an in-text citation (eg, Video 1). At the end of the manuscript file, include a title (a brief phrase, preferably no longer than 10 to 15 words) and a caption that includes the file format and a brief explanation for each video. The same title and caption must be entered in the designated fields in the manuscript submission system when uploading each video. If multiple video files are submitted, number them in the order in which they should be viewed.

If patient(s) are identifiable in the video, authors must submit a Patient Permission form completed and signed by each patient. See also Patient Identification.

If the author does not hold copyright to the video, the author must obtain permission for the video to be published in the journal. This permission must be for unrestricted use in all print, online, and licensed versions of the journal.

NOTE: If your manuscript and accompanying videos are accepted for publication, the video files will be placed into a journal video frame and will be edited by JAMA Network video production staff according to journal style. In addition, a JAMA Network staff person may contact you to resubmit your videos to meet our production specifications. For example, a larger size may be needed, and if your videos were submitted with embedded text such as titles, annotations, labels, or captions, we will ask you to remove the text at this stage and resubmit the video without text, and JAMA Network video production will re-create all text using our house style.

Guidelines for Optimal Video Quality
Use plenty of diffuse light; avoid shadows.
When filming, please use a landscape orientation, not a portrait orientation. This is especially important when filming video or taking photographs with a smartphone or a mobile device.
Use the appropriate white-balance based on your lighting conditions. Different cameras have different settings, but most have presets for incandescent (yellow) light, fluorescent light, daylight, and tungsten light. Please make sure to select the correct one so that the color of your footage renders accurately.
Do not overexpose the image; a bit underexposed is preferable.
Use a tripod. This is especially important in close-ups.
Avoid excessive zooming. Use the optical zoom only; do not use a digital zoom.
Turn off all camera special effects.
Avoid using autofocus. Manual focus is more accurate. Keep the camera at a fixed distance from the subject.
Instruct people on camera to speak clearly and face the camera when speaking. Try to avoid large movements while speaking or immediately after speaking. Allow pauses before and after speaking for easier editing.
If the situation permits, ensure that individuals being filmed are not wearing white clothing or clothing with busy patterns or stripes, especially shirts, jackets, and ties. Subdued medium blue, brown, tan, beige, and green colors all work well for shirt and clothing choices.
Do not include an introduction by the physician as a "talking head" explaining a procedure. All footage should be of the procedure or relevant subject matter only.
Record a few extra seconds before and after each cut or after changing the camera's position. This allows for easier editing.

      <summary> Additional Considerations for Filming Surgical Procedures </summary>
      <br>


Coordinate with the surgical staff to establish a vantage point for the camera that has a clear view of the surgical field.
Before the procedure, if the situation permits, identify the surgical staff's positions for access into and out of the surgical field to ensure there is no immediate obstruction of the camera.
During the procedure, avoid typical obstructions of the camera's main view such as arms reaching across the field or soiled surgical sponges. Where possible, keep the heads, hands, and any instruments away from the immediate sightline of the camera. This will ensure that all moments of the procedure are captured in full view and focus.
If the situation permits a choice of glove type, use brown or tan. White gloves reflect bright light; vividly colored surgical gloves can distract the viewer from the teaching point of the video.
If the situation permits, avoid rapid movements for procedural steps that should be noticed and understood. To demonstrate a key moment or use of an instrument, movement that is deliberate and steady will allow a standard camera to focus properly.

      <summary> Audio </summary>
      <br>
For editorial and review of an initial submission, submit audio files according to the following minimum requirements:

Acceptable file formats: .mp3, .wav, or .aiff
Maximum file size: 25 MB
To achieve the best quality, use a setting of 256 kbps or higher for stereo or 128 kbps or higher for mono.
Maximum length: ≤5 minutes
Sampling rate should be either 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.
Bit rate should be either 16 or 24 bit.
To avoid audible clipping noise, please make sure that audio levels do not exceed 0 dBFS.
For each audio file, provide an in-text citation. At the end of the manuscript, include a title (a brief phrase, preferably no longer than 10-15 words) and a caption that includes the file format and a brief explanation for each audio.

NOTE: If your manuscript is accepted for publication, JAMA Network video production staff may contact you to request an original uncompressed audio file in .wav or .aiff format. There is no maximum file size requirement for publication at this stage.
